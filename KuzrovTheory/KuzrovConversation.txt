[Kuzrov]- I knew it.
[Zawqax]- Should have followed you.
[Kuzrov]- When does Novayana's plan start?
[Zawqax]- It began once they took power.
[Zawqax]- They lead everything now.
[Kuzrov]- I was also a part of the SPG. 
[Kuzrov]- I was the one who started Zerkov.
[Zawqax]- No way.
[Kuzrov]- Yes way.
[Kuzrov]- As a Hyperquasiphysicist, I know my statistics and calculations.
[Kuzrov]- And I knew Zerkov was an opportunity for overthrowing KBLandia.
[Zawqax]- What was up with KB anyways?
[Kuzrov]- He contacted another surviving civilization.
[Kuzrov]- Alpha Centauri.
[Zawqax]- Good thing we stopped them.
[Kuzrov]- At what cost?
[Kuzrov]- KB is gone.
[Kuzrov]- It was never supposed to be gone.
